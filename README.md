# LianaModel

Dear visitor,
Dear Liana enthousiast!

This is a first version of a new liana model, which will be discussed in an upcomming paper (now submitted).
Please find in the folder the first upload of all model code, required datasets, and scripts to perform all analysis in the main document of the submitted manuscript.
The code will be cleaned further upon acceptance to make it more user-friendly.
The current code is annotated, and allows the user to (given author restriction of some datasets used) to perform all the analysis presented in 
the main document of the submitted paper. Simply open and follow the document 'analisis_v6' in your matlab software and the annotated code will help guide you through all the analysis and model code.

In case thing are unclear, let me know, and i can provide additional information (and can make sure this will be made more clear in later versions of the code)

# NOTE ABOUT LIMITATIONS BY PROTECTED DATASETS:
I am not able to provide all the data to perform all the analysis (i.e., those of processing the Cannopy Occupancy Index, or the benchmarking of initial data from the BCI data)
However, feel encouraged to contact me for additional processing scripts. 
This will be provided upon request, with the condition of a approval provided by the people owning those specific datasets (note that i can request approval for you if needed)

Kind regards,

Hannes
